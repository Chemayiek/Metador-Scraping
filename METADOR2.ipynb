The district also encompasses Sarphatipark, a two-block rectangle of green with a lake, small bridges, and playground equipment.

      "Description: King’s Day— Little can prepare you for the orange-tinged madness of King’s Day, orKoningsdag, the national holiday that gives the Dutch an excuse to party hard for over 24 hours. In Amsterdam alone, over a million revelers spill onto streets and canals, ostensibly to celebrate King Willem-Alexander’s birthday on April 27 (if his birthday lands on a Sunday, the holiday is celebrated on April 26). The fun begins the night before on King’s Night (Koningsnacht) when bars and public squares overflow with people. The next morning, the city turns into a giant flea market,or vrijmarkt, which is the only day anyone can sell anything on the street tax-free. As the afternoon winds down, the party ramps up with live music, street vendors, pop-up bars, and dancing in the streets.\n",

Designed in the English landscape style, Oosterpark has a natural feel, with a pond populated by grey herons and a few rare, wild parrots. Among the numerous monuments are one commemorating the abolition of slavery in the Netherlands in 1861 and another honoring Theo van Gogh, a distant cousin of the painter who was murdered in 2004 by a Muslim extremist. Streams, walking paths, and a children’s wading pool make this a great place to chill, with fewer tourists than Vondelpark or Westerpark — except in July, when Oosterpark hosts theAmsterdam Roots Festival, the city’s largest world music event.\n",

It was in 2007, after the construction of the Kerameikos metro station that old warehouses transformed into trendy nightclubs and streets became awash with 20-somethings. Gazi also houses theGazarteandTechnopoliscultural hubs that bring theater performances, exhibitions, and annual festivals to the community. The area is also among the most hospitable areas in the city toward the LGBTQ community with dedicated bars and clubs. Cross Pireos Avenue and step into Keramikos, the edge of ancient Athens, where the first public cemetery was allocated back in 2700 BC. Low-key Keramikos links the buzzing city center of Athens with the booming Gazi, but that’s not all it does.

To the right of the Propylaea is the temple of Athena Nike. Here, citizens worshipped the goddess of Victory hoping for an ending of the war against the Spartans. The Erechtheion on the north side of the Acropolis is a temple dedicated to Athena and Poseidon, famous for the Porch of the Maidens, composed of six female statues which act as supporting pillars for the roof.

In contrast, Art Deco and Georgian shopfronts can be found the whole length of Donegal Place and Royal Avenue.

Today, it offers a vast network of cycling and running paths, pleasant meadows for sunbathing, picturesque lakes and flower gardens, and a couple of great beer gardens. Look out for interesting sculptures like the Global Stone peace project, historic memorials for murdered political activists like Rosa Luxemburg, and the park’s progressive cultural institution, the Haus der Kulturen der Welt (House of World Cultures).\n",

The quality is thanks to chef-owner, Jasper White, who patented the cooking process. Savor that succulent crustacean “in the rough” (steamed with melted butter), as part of a clam bake (with steamed mussels, clams, corn, and potatoes), grilled, pan-roasted with bourbon, or butter-poached and dressed in mayo in a lobster roll. This lively, colorful, family-friendly restaurant has wooden tables, tiki cocktails, chalkboard specials, and Boston’s largest raw bar that holds 2,000-plus morsels of seafood. It also offers both dressy to casual options ranging from seafood towers and pan-roasted haddock with mushroom sherry butter to lobster-corn fritters and shack-style fish tacos. Yes, there’s also steak if you’re not up for seafood.\n",

      "Description: Wicker Park— While it’s been a long time since anybody would call Wicker Park edgy, the neighborhood still has an indie atmosphere. The neighborhood’s bars mostly avoid frat-boy vibes, and people who live here are pretty likely to be pierced and tattooed, even if they work downtown corporate jobs. Wicker Park is dotted with beautiful German and Scandinavian mansions from the late 19th century, with the highest concentration of these along Hoyne Avenue going south from North Avenue. Check out these gorgeous homes and shop in the boutiques along Milwaukee Avenue by day, and at night make sure to explore the neighborhood’s great live music venues, excellent restaurants, and its booming bar scene that sees the streets crowded on Friday and Saturday evenings. For a great night out in Wicker Park, grab a beer and pizza atPiece Brewery and Pizzeria, catch a concert atSubterranean, then get late-night dive bar drinks atEstelle’s.\n",

      "Description: Logan Square— One of the city’s fastest-changing neighborhoods, Logan Square is now full of people who just a decade ago would have thought the neighborhood too dangerous to venture into. Today you’ll find all sorts of Chicagoans around Logan Square, but there is a definite artistic and hip vibe. Logan Square has some of the city’s best new restaurants like the excellentSuperkhana International, which does playful takes on Indian classics. Along the neighborhood’s main stretch of Milwaukee Avenue is a vibrant bar scene and lots of great breweries, cafes, bakeries, and a health food co-op. Pair your dinner with a movie by visiting theLogan Theatre, an independent cinema-bar hybrid that’s been around since 1915. The movie theater shows Hollywood blockbusters as well as independent and throwback flicks. Many of the original features, such as a stained glass arch and marble walls, have been meticulously restored.\n",

      "Description: Pilsen— Originally settled by Czech immigrants (hence the name), Pilsen has been predominantly Mexican for some time now, despite its slow but sure gentrification. You’ll find the city’s best Mexican restaurants here, as well as street art pieces and community murals that are part of a dynamic art scene with roots in the politics of the ‘60s and ‘70s. Locals will always argue about the best restaurants, but a few favorites areAtotonilcoandEl Milagro, which besides making great food of its own also makes tortillas for most of the city’s Mexican restaurants. Check out the wonderful (and free)National Museum of Mexican Artto see some beautiful folk art and works of artisanship that document the culture of Mexico and of the Mexican-American experience in the US. For most people, the highlight here is the collection of Día de los Muertos masks and other items used to celebrate the Day of the Dead.\n",

The actual park that gives the neighborhood its name is beautiful, with gardens, a lagoon, wetlands, and ballfields that host some competitive baseball and softball games on weekends and evenings when the weather is warm. Touring the park is one of the highlights of the neighborhood. Don’t miss the Formal Garden and the boathouse, which has a great cafe with views over the lagoon and where you can rent paddle boats in the summer. A number of good restaurants and bars have opened here in recent years, like the wonderfulCafé Marie-Jeannethat has the feel of a small neighborhood bistro in Paris. Of course, you can still get some excellent Puerto Rican food in Humboldt Park — check outLa Bombafor a sit-down meal, or any of the food trucks in the park if you’re on the go.\n",

Two of those old dance halls,Aragon BallroomandRiviera Theatre, are killer concert venues today. The neighboring Andersonville was once Chicago’s Little Sweden and today is a fun place to hang with many bars, cafes, and restaurants. It’s also one of Chicago’s most LGBTQ-friendly areas. Straddling the two neighborhoods, Little Saigon along Argyle Street is an ethnic enclave with a number of delicious Vietnamese restaurants, as well as great Thai, Chinese, and Hmong food.Tank Noodlesits on the corner at the heart of the neighborhood and is considered to serve the neighborhood’s best Vietnamese food.\n",

There’s also DePaul University which keeps the neighborhood young and fun. Lakeview borders Lincoln Park to the north and contains the smaller neighborhoods of Boystown and Wrigleyville within it. The two areas have some of the city’s densest concentration of bars and restaurants, and there’s always something fun to do here. If you’re more into bro-ish sports bars, check out the legendary Cubby Bear kitty-corner to the famous Wrigley Field Marquee. For a fun LGBTQ-friendly scene, hit up Boystown and head toBerlinto dance late into the night to always-excellent music. Where Wicker Park and Logan Square lean more toward the trendy and creative crowd, these neighborhoods lean more to business types, with large numbers of graduates of the big 10 universities around the Midwest flocking here. Both these neighborhoods run along the lake and the entirety of the lakefront here is all beaches and green space that make up the actualLincoln Park.

The Loop is named for the elevated train tracks that circle the city center and has little going on outside the Monday-to-Friday work hours, but still, it’s definitely worth hopping on a Brown, Pink, Orange, or Purple Line train to ride around and see the city from a different vantage point. Just outside the Loop,Millennium Park,Maggie Daley Park, andGrant Parkare all worth checking out for their sculptures (the famous “Bean” is found in Millennium Park), fountains, gardens, and incredible views of the skyscrapers to one side, and the blue lake to the other. TheChicago Riverwalkis a beautiful public space and has some of the best views of the classic bridges and high-rises looming over the river’s green waters. To the southeast, the Museum Campus could take days to fully explore with theField Museum,Shedd Aquarium, and theAdler Planetarium.

TheMuseum of Science and Industryis one of the city’s best and always has something interesting for all ages. Behind the museum, Jackson Park was once the site of the 1893 Columbian Exposition and is a gorgeous green space full of gardens, sports fields, a beach, a golf course, and some lovely lagoons. Going west from the park, the Midway Plaisance is a wide boulevard at the center of the U of C campus. Nearby there are some beautiful homes that are worth seeing, the best of which is Chicago architectFrank Lloyd Wright’s Robie Housewhere you can and should take a tour. Hyde Park is also a great neighborhood for soul food; check outThe Soul Shackfor all of the classics.\n",

The restaurant is a tribute to beer, pork, and oysters, and the menu covers a wide range of perfectly executed farmhouse fare. If you ask Chicago chefs what their favorite restaurants are, The Publican will make the list more than just about any other spot in the city.

Tours are offered Friday to Sunday at 1:00 PM and cost $20, but you can take in much of the splendor on your own by walking through the main hall, down its wings lined with shops and restaurants, and outside across the back of the property.\n",

There are parties nearly every night at bars across town, but you’ll want to pay particular attention to the concert lineup atThe Grizzly Rose. The most notorious part of the two weeks is the event that, for better or worse, first cemented Denver’s western roots over 100 years ago: theCow Parade. Hundreds of longhorn cattle walk through the streets of downtown from Union Station accompanied by ranchers and thousands of revelers, who tend to turn the area into a scene reminiscent of the Fourth of July.\n",

Serving as the anchor of its fascination with suds, the beer industry hosts its biggest party of the year at the Colorado Convention Center over the first weekend in October, and it’s turned into a right of passage of sorts for craft brewers from far beyond the city limits. The annual Great American Beer Festival brings over 4,000 beers from breweries around the world. Saturday night tends to get particularly rowdy with thousands of revelers moving from the event to the pubs of downtown in a series of slightly organized, stumbling pub crawls. If you want to avoid the madness, go on Thursday night or Sunday morning, but take heed: Tickets sell out in a matter of minutes. Stay tuned to the website and newsletter, and be ready to click the ‘Buy’ button as soon as they go on sale. It’s also worth springing for the Paired tickets, which grant you access to epic food pairings from local chefs along with all those brews. If you fail to land tickets, you can still enjoy some of the fun — loads of breweries across the metro area host events throughout the week highlighted by brew tour bike rides, yoga sessions, and pairings.\n",

There’s even a little fish and chip shop, an ice cream parlor, and an amusement arcade for an authentically English holiday experience.\n",

It’s just over half an hour from Piccadilly to Disley, a stone village on the western periphery of the Peak District National Park. Next to Disley is Lyme Park, a 1,400-acre parkland estate belonging to the National Trust. The estate is free to visit, but you can also pay to enter the lavishly decorated Regency mansion and the manicured gardens. The estate covers an unbeatable range of experiences, from walks through wooded glades that burst with seasonal wildflowers to open plains where herds of red deer run. If you were a fan of theBBCadaptation ofPride and Prejudice, then note that this is also the place where they filmed the famous scene where Mr. Darcy emerges dripping from the freezing pond.\n",

Numerous popular walks run through the forest, some hilly and strenuous, some more gentle. All of them will take you through some of the area’s best and best-loved countryside. If you like dogs, then the pedigree chums of the area will definitely be there to keep you company, as it’s a number-one spot for dog walkers.

It’s easy to do the whole five-mile path by bike, but there are also lots of good points to walk, such as the section from Chorlton to Levenshulme, where the profusion of wild blackberry bushes at the end of summer means the way is regularly packed with locals foraging for fruit.

Celebrations are as colorful, festive, and diverse as you can imagine. While the most famous Día de los Muertos celebrations occur in Oaxaca, there are still many wonderful festivities throughout Mexico City. The community of San Andrés Mixquic, in the south end of Mexico City, holds the most traditional celebration, with a vigil at the local cemetery, which gets adorned with flowers and thousands of candles. Near Centro Histórico, parades and monumental ofrendas flood every public plaza and hordes of people dressed up as the famousCatrinacan be seen roaming around the city streets. The main parade is traditionally held the weekend before Day of the Dead, and ofrendas start appearing throughout the city during that same week. The main square of Zócalo, theDolores Olmedo Museum, and Casa Fuerte de Emilio “El Indio” Fernández are the most famous and impressive places for ofrendas each year.\n",

You’ll also want to drop in on Maximo Gomez Park to peep at theabuelitosplaying dominoes, then head to the nearestventanillafor a shot of Cuban coffee. For an authentic Miami hamburger, grab afritaat El Rey de Las Fritas, or for a larger selection of Cuban food head a little west toVersailles.

Well, now we call them “street artists” and no neighborhood in the world has a larger, denser concentration of their creations than Wynwood. This former industrial wasteland has been transformed over the last decade into America’s premier outdoor museum, where colorful, provocative murals fill tons of city blocks.

Though South Florida isn’t exactly ideal for growing grapes, at Schnebly you can try wine made from avocado, mango, and other tropical fruits. Just make sure to keep your mind open.

      "Description: Pabst Theater— ThePabst Theateris an icon of Milwaukee’s entertainment district, providing a stage for musicians, comedians, opera, and theater. This historic landmark was built in 1895, making it the fourth-oldest continually running theater in the United States. Designed in the style of a German opera house, the Pabst Theater has a palatial Baroque interior with a crystal chandelier and a white Carrara marble staircase. Relics of the theater’s long life still call the Pabst home, like an organ that once provided accompaniment for silent films and a counterweight system for lifting scenery, installed after World War I and believed to be the first in the world. As relevant today as it was over a century ago, the Pabst has undergone frequent renovations to keep it up-to-date with modern technology, such as the addition of elevators to improve accessibility — while still preserving its historic heart.\n",

Lancaster is also known for its large Amish community, where modern dress and technology are shunned. You can explore Amish life through tours of Amish villages, led either by the Amish or ex-Amish community members; buggy rides; and farmers markets that sell Amish-made furniture, quilts, toys, and produce.\n",

      "Description: Sea Isle City, New Jersey— Philadelphians love “going down the shore.” Sea Isle City is one of the closest New Jersey beaches, only an hour and 20 minutes away by driving, and accessible via Greyhound bus. The long, yellow sand beaches are the perfect place to chill, while the mild waves are great for cooling off or surfing. Just pay attention to weather alerts, as sometimes there are dangerous rip currents. When the sun goes down, head to the promenade, which borders the far edge of the beach. There are shops, an arcade, and dinner options at Sea Isle’s popular seafood restaurants or theSunset Pierbar and restaurant.\n",

      "Description: Brandywine Creek State Park, Delaware— Only 40 minutes from Philadelphia, this park is a peaceful getaway from the city. With 1,000 acres of hills, woodland, and meadows, it’s an ideal spot for hikers who want to explore the 14 miles of trails. The Brandywine Creek is filled with bass and trout, so it’s a popular fishing spot. There’s even a disc golf course, which is $8 for out-of-state visitors. When it’s summer, bring a tube to lazily drift along the Brandywine Creek. In the winter, trade the water tube for a toboggan, and sled down one of Brandywine’s hills. It’s popular during the fall and winter months, so keep that in mind when planning your trip.\n",

      "Description: Valley Forge, Pennsylvania— It’s no secret that Philadelphia has some of the US’ most important historic sites. If you’re visiting to experience some of that history, don’t just limit yourself to the city boundaries. Valley Forge, a 35-minute drive away, is the spot where George Washington’s army suffered through a harsh winter during the Revolutionary War. Exhibits include group tours of the encampment, Washington’s headquarters, and artillery park with real Revolutionary-era cannons. In addition to the history, Valley Forge is also a park with 19.5 miles of hiking trails and 21 miles of biking trails. After checking out the history, you can unwind by hiking or biking; you can rent bikes over the weekends in spring and fall, and every summer day, at theEncampment Store. Pick up food before you go and enjoy a picnic at the park; there are several designated picnic areas and even grills for a cookout.\n",

It requires putting “skins” on the bottom of a pair of skis or onto a transitional snowboard known as a splitboard and skiing uphill. Aspen has a more open policy towards uphill access than most major resorts, allowing it at all four of their mountains. On Fridays, you can uphill to the Cliffhouse on Buttermilk Mountain for a cheap hot breakfast.\n",

The much safer way to get into the backcountry is with a guide. They’ll provide the backpacks although you’ll also want to rent touring skis/snowboards with skins.

      "Description: The Acropolis— The term “acropolis” means “a city built on a hill,” and that’s no euphemism. The Acropolis of Athens is impressive from all vantage points, but you must climb for 45 minutes to the top to admire the monuments, which are all symbols of ancient Athens’ power and prosperity. The Propylaea — a 78-foot-long gate with two smaller wings — is the point of entry to the Acropolis and the highest point of the Sacred Way, which leads to the Acropolis. To the right of the Propylaea is the temple of Athena Nike. Here, citizens worshipped the goddess of Victory hoping for an ending of the war against the Spartans. The Erechtheion on the north side of the Acropolis is a temple dedicated to Athena and Poseidon, famous for the Porch of the Maidens, composed of six female statues which act as supporting pillars for the roof. Last, the symbol of ancient Greece, the Parthenon — a temple dedicated to Athena, the patron of the city.\n",

During turbulent periods like the rule of the Ottoman Empire between the 15th and 19th centuries, World War II, and the civil war (1946-1949), Orthodox Christianity kept the morale of the Greeks high. Even though for younger generations religion in Greece is more a matter of tradition and cultural identity than systematic participation, Christianity remains closely interlinked with politics and education.\n",

As the sun sets on the 23rd, locals light up the beaches with bonfires, writing negative things they’d like to leave behind on strips of paper, and casting them into the fire to symbolically start anew. Some people even leap over the bonfires, but everyone will jump into the water when midnight strikes.

Neither beach is crowded, and both are great for swimming. The jetty at the far end of Castelldefels forms a natural wave that can be surfed albeit only with a longboard. Both beaches are only 20 or so minutes by car, so you could just come here for an afternoon.\n",

It opened in 1994 with a focus on the spicy cuisine of Sichuan province, and this hot pot chain now serves as an industry-loved treasure that sets the bar for service standards in restaurants. Upon entering, you’re greeted by multiple staff. Cross your fingers that you have to wait for a table, as that’s when you can take advantage of the free manicures, shoe shines, board games, and other inventive ways to make waiting fly by. Be sure to order the hand-pulled noodles, as they are delivered by a man who whips the strings around in midair before delivering them to the boiling pot in the middle of the table while fun techno music blares from a little speaker attached to his belt.\n",

Highlights include a ride through the building process of the ship, recreations of the different cabins aboard the ship, as well as the grand staircase made famous by the 1997 movie. A big focus of the museum is on the amazing construction of the ship and all its glamorous features — less so on its tragic fate — but the final floors do offer a sobering look into the ship’s final moments at sea, along with findings from the undersea wreckage. In the surrounding area, guests can also find tributes to the thousands of Belfast shipyard workers who built the Titanic and similar ships over the centuries.

WhileGame of Thrones toursare available, avid fans who want to get a taste of the real Winterfell can also explore the area independently. Most of the sites from the show can be reached by car in under an hour. Highlights include the Castle Ward estate where Winterfell scenes are shot and the banks of Strangford Lough and Tollymore Forest Park, which are used for many of the wilderness shots.\n",

Bushmills isn’t just the oldest Irish whiskey distillery, it’s the oldest continually licensed distillery, period. It received a grant from King James in 1608, and the trademark license in 1784. Every batch of Bushmills is made onsite at this distillery, farm-to-glass, making it one of the few brands where the quality of the spirit is on par with its mass popularity. A tour costs just under a tenner, and takes you through the history of Irish whiskey distilling and the Bushmills brand, and more importantly, includes a sample of five expressions.\n",

The city also has a surprisingly hip art and nightlife scene thanks to an influx of young creatives over the last decade or so. Look out for work by the New Leipzig School and visit the Baumwollspinnerei (aka Spinnerei), a fascinating collection of artist ateliers and edgy galleries set in a former factory complex.\n",

Its current incarnation was designed by royal architects and planners like Peter Joseph Lenné and Karl Friedrich Schinkel, and its name comes from the peacocks, which were introduced at this time and which still roam free today. The distinctive fairy-tale castle, the island’s architectural highlight, was built by the Prussian king Frederick William II in 1793 for him and his mistress Wilhelmine Enke.

But for those who prefer to spend time outdoors, the neighborhood is also home to many green spaces, including Bosques de Palermo, a huge urban park where porteños hang out during the evenings and weekends. Because it is quite big, Palermo is divided into smaller sections, some of which should definitely go straight to the top of your must-hit list.\n",

Villa Crespo is also the core of the Jewish community in Buenos Aires, so it’s a great spot for delis and eateries with kosher, as well as Arabic, food.\n",

The place is super busy with crowds checking out the antique fair on Plaza Dorrego on the weekends, so we suggest you visit during the week. This neighborhood is full of cool street art (don’t miss the adorableMafaldamonument) but it’s also known for being one of the places where foreign visitors get robbed the most, so just be mindful of your stuff while you wander around.\n",

Then walk around Plaza de Mayo, the heart of the city, and take a stroll down Avenida de Mayo for about 20 minutes to visitPalacio Barolo, Buenos Aires’ most emblematic building. The place was inspired by Dante Alighieri’sDivine Comedy, so each of its 22 floors has symbolic references to it, and you get a fantastic view of Buenos Aires from the top floor.

Today it’s best known as the home of the University of Chicago and the former home of the pre-presidential Obamas, but there’s a lot more going on. TheMuseum of Science and Industryis one of the city’s best and always has something interesting for all ages. Behind the museum, Jackson Park was once the site of the 1893 Columbian Exposition and is a gorgeous green space full of gardens, sports fields, a beach, a golf course, and some lovely lagoons. Going west from the park, the Midway Plaisance is a wide boulevard at the center of the U of C campus. Nearby there are some beautiful homes that are worth seeing, the best of which is Chicago architectFrank Lloyd Wright’s Robie Housewhere you can and should take a tour. Hyde Park is also a great neighborhood for soul food; check outThe Soul Shackfor all of the classics.\n",

The pricing is dynamic, so a Saturday night will cost more than a Tuesday. Tickets should be bought in advance, though they do release some day-of tickets on their Facebook page.\n",

If you get hungry, you can take on Truck Yard’s famous Texas Philly Cheesesteak or check out one of the several food trucks that rotate daily. Don’t forget to head up to the top of the treehouse for some great people/dog watching from above. Live music on Saturdays.\n",

When you walk in you’ll see the remnants — a billiard table and some old art and trinkets — from the old Slip-Inn. However, when you turn the corner it’s all club with a DJ booth, bottle service tables you can reserve and, of course, the dance floor. It’s the little things that make this place worth a visit, like the ability to order a 40-ounce bottle of malt liquor that comes in a brown bag. The dance floor is best on Fridays and Saturdays after 11:00 PM. If the line is too long,High Fivesis directly next door and worth an honorable mention on the list.\n",

Stay tuned to the website and newsletter, and be ready to click the ‘Buy’ button as soon as they go on sale. It’s also worth springing for the Paired tickets, which grant you access to epic food pairings from local chefs along with all those brews. If you fail to land tickets, you can still enjoy some of the fun — loads of breweries across the metro area host events throughout the week highlighted by brew tour bike rides, yoga sessions, and pairings.\n",

But what most guidebooks and movies don’t show is how to crack open that nutshell and get to the core of what actually is a cool place to spend a day. First off, there’s the Maroon Bells, a stunning series of peaks that create perhaps the most scenic pull-off in Colorado. It’s only $10 per vehicle to take it all in, including the numerous hiking trails. Closer to town proper, a solid hike, scenic drive, or good happy hour are totally possible. You just have to know where to look, or else you’ll ask for the tab and realize you just spent $50 on two beers and a basket of fries, and another $100 to rent a bike for the afternoon. Skip the lift ticket to hike Aspen Mountain and instead opt for the free trails at Smuggler Mountain.

The center of this ever-hip and bohemian neighborhood is the Plaza Dos de Mayo, but there are other small squares like Las Comendadoras or San Ildefonso, around where there are bars and cafes worth checking out. If you’re here after dinner, venture over toKike Keller, an art and design store which turns into a swanky cocktail bar during the weekends.

On its way to the Irish Sea, the Mersey runs for many miles, and its winding pathways are always in use by walkers and cyclists. It’s largely unpaved, so if you do come on a bicycle, be prepared for some rough stuff. One particularly fine section for getting a flavor of the soft waters and grassy banks is from Manchester’s West Didsbury neighborhood to Parrs Wood. Access the path from Stanton Avenue in Didsbury and follow the river southeast until you hit the Waterside Hotel for refreshments.\n",

Its location next to the Bellas Artes Palace makes it easily accessible from both the Centro Histórico and Paseo de la Reforma. This is a great spot to recharge after a day walking around the Centro Histórico, and it’s within walking distance of important attractions such as the Chapultepec, Franz Mayer Museum, Latin American Tower, and aforementioned Bellas Artes. The whole park is packed with fountains and sculptures, some of which date back to the mid-19th century.\n",

Once you’re done with the archeological area, head to La Gruta, a unique restaurant inside a cave that’s just a few minutes from the pyramids.

Iztaccíhuatl is not active, and it’s a popular climb among mountaineers, but you can also hike along one of several routes that roam around the volcano. El Paso is an hour drive from Mexico City and can only be reached by car.

You can find some tour providers online, but the best way to get there is by car, so either rent one or convince a local friend to get you there. Reaching the Nevado will take you around two and a half hours from Mexico City, but you really want to arrive there early since the weather can be unpredictable in the afternoons.

      "Description: The Mondrian South Beach— The inherent problem with beachfront hotels in Miami, if you ever dare to complain about being at a beachfront hotel in Miami, is that during high season, the sun has dipped behind the hotel by 1:00 PM, and you’re left to spend the rest of the day sunbathing in the shade. Not so at the west-facing Mondrian, where this luxe space has a crescent-shaped pool right on Biscayne Bay, with spectacular views out over the Miami skyline. This means the sun hits the pool all afternoon, and you can enjoy the live DJ and swanky cocktails all the way to sunset. The rooms aren’t bad either, as this converted apartment building offers many junior suites with kitchens and big, spacious balconies to watch the sunset from.\n",

The interior of the main entrance feels like something akin to boarding a spacecraft, with a soaring arched ceiling and enormous glass panes spanning from the floor to the top of the arch. The structure’s striking architecture and views over Lake Michigan are reason enough to visit, and the collection of works from internationally celebrated artists like Georgia O’Keeffe, Pablo Picasso, Joan Miro, Andy Warhol, and many more are additional incentives to explore all four floors of the museum. Once a month, the museum hosts MAM After Dark, themed Friday-night parties with topical gallery tours, live performances, music, cocktails, crafts, and dancing.

There are shops, an arcade, and dinner options at Sea Isle’s popular seafood restaurants or theSunset Pierbar and restaurant.\n",

      "Description: Brandywine Creek State Park, Delaware— Only 40 minutes from Philadelphia, this park is a peaceful getaway from the city. With 1,000 acres of hills, woodland, and meadows, it’s an ideal spot for hikers who want to explore the 14 miles of trails. The Brandywine Creek is filled with bass and trout, so it’s a popular fishing spot. There’s even a disc golf course, which is $8 for out-of-state visitors. When it’s summer, bring a tube to lazily drift along the Brandywine Creek. In the winter, trade the water tube for a toboggan, and sled down one of Brandywine’s hills. It’s popular during the fall and winter months, so keep that in mind when planning your trip.\n",

      "Description: Valley Forge, Pennsylvania— It’s no secret that Philadelphia has some of the US’ most important historic sites. If you’re visiting to experience some of that history, don’t just limit yourself to the city boundaries. Valley Forge, a 35-minute drive away, is the spot where George Washington’s army suffered through a harsh winter during the Revolutionary War. Exhibits include group tours of the encampment, Washington’s headquarters, and artillery park with real Revolutionary-era cannons. In addition to the history, Valley Forge is also a park with 19.5 miles of hiking trails and 21 miles of biking trails. After checking out the history, you can unwind by hiking or biking; you can rent bikes over the weekends in spring and fall, and every summer day, at theEncampment Store. Pick up food before you go and enjoy a picnic at the park; there are several designated picnic areas and even grills for a cookout.\n",
